# Maya

Maya is a chat client for LLMs to experiment with multi-agent and multi-human conversations.

It is built in React Native, with a FastAPI backend (The Oracle), and MongoDB datastore.

---------

### Todos
In progress:
- Build message refresh
- Build websockets
  - Helper function for websocket to create the right json
  - Enable websocket to route different commands
- Create new message, select AIs
- Build out discussion protocol, to allow other devs to implement a different framework
- Build out discussion on server w/ multiple LLMs

Next up:
- Build auth/verify/profile
- Include authtoken in each HTTP request

Backlog:
- Build web demo on maya url
- Allow custom avatars (cloudflare CDN)
- Secure storage rather than async storage
- Push notifications
- Invite ppl via sms
- Host on maya url rather than txtai.co
- Expire login codes
- Enable multiple dynos via redis/pubsub

-------

### Maya backend architecture

Maya chat operates on a websocket for the following functions:
- Sending/receiving messages
- Creating/updating chats

Additionally it has the following API endpoints:
- Websocket (manages message sending/receiving and creating/updating chats)
- Refresh (updates the chat list and recent messages)
- Update profile (updates a user's username/avatar)
- Auth / verify (sms based authentication)

## Installation

Install/update xcode and command line tools

Install node, watchman (via homebrew), and cocoapods (view rubygems, ruby version 2.7.x)

```
brew install node
brew install watchman
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

>See [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, if you have trouble.

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

#### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
